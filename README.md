# Audio to .aiff sample converter for SM64 Decomp/PC port
This is a tool for converting audio files to aiff samples that you can use for the SM64 Decompilation or the PC port.

Might introduce a GUI version soon, but I'm not sure about it, we'll just have to wait for that.

# Usage
In a bash shell:
```cd <directory>
python3 main.py
```
