# Audio to AIFF Sample Converter for SM64 (1.0)
Powered by FFmpeg and ffmpeg-python, This is a tool for converting audio files to AIFF samples that you can use for the SM64 Decompilation or the PC port.

Might introduce a GUI version soon, but I'm not sure about it, we'll just have to wait for that.

## Downloading

There should be a download for the tool in Releases. 
FFmpeg and ffmpeg-python will have to be installed seperately.

## Usage

In a bash shell:
```cd <directory>
python3 main.py
```

## Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome.
